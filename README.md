# scifi_book_game
## Project Background
After months of stressful participation in the KU Data Analytics Bootcamp, we wanted to escape into a good scifi book. If we were ambitious enough, we might even write a scifi book.

Goal: Make predictions on scifi books based on the plot description from the Kaggle data set

We have developed a web page which uses machine learning to predict the success of a book and the subgenre based on the plot description.
